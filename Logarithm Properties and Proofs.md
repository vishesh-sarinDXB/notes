# Logarithm Properties

## Product Rule
The product rule states the sum of two logarithms is equal to the logarithm of a product:

```math
\log_B(A) + \log_B(C) = \log_B(AC)
```

Proof:

Note that logarithms 

```math
\log_B(A) = x \iff B^x = A
\log_B(C) = y \iff B^y = C
\log_B(AC) = z \iff B^z = AC
```
